Smart Watering System for indoor plants to 3D print

To build the project on your own, you have to buy theese components:

We've created a smart watering system for indoor plants to 3D print. 
The 3D files are in the STL folder. You can print them by your own. Maybe you have to seal the water tank with some ducktape, because some 3D-Printers can't print it to hold the water.
The files for the ESP32 are in the Code folder. You can upload them to the ESP32 by using VS Code with Pymakr. Make sure you have installed MicroPython on the ESP first, otherwise it won't work.
